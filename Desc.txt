Creating a detailed architecture for a framework capable of streaming data from Kafka, Pub/Sub, and other streaming platforms using Apache Beam, and then writing the data into multiple tables in a dataset, involves several components and steps. Below is a comprehensive explanation of the architecture, its components, capabilities, and how it works.

---

### **Architecture Overview**
The framework is designed to handle real-time data streaming, processing, and storage in a scalable and configuration-driven manner. It leverages Apache Beam for pipeline execution, ensuring portability across different data processing engines (e.g., Google Dataflow, Apache Flink, Apache Spark). The framework is highly configurable, with all user-specific details stored in configuration tables in an MSSQL Server.

---

### **Key Components of the Architecture**
1. **Data Sources**:
   - Kafka: A distributed streaming platform for handling real-time data feeds.
   - Pub/Sub: A messaging service for streaming data between applications.
   - Other Streaming Platforms: Any platform that supports real-time data streaming (e.g., Amazon Kinesis, RabbitMQ).

2. **Apache Beam Pipeline**:
   - The core processing engine that handles data ingestion, transformation, and loading.
   - Provides a unified model for batch and stream processing.

3. **Configuration Tables (MSSQL Server)**:
   - Stores all user-defined configurations, such as:
     - Data source details (e.g., Kafka topic, Pub/Sub subscription).
     - Pipeline transformations (e.g., flattening logic).
     - Destination table schemas and mappings.
     - Polling intervals and error handling rules.

4. **Data Polling Layer**:
   - Continuously polls data from the configured streaming platforms.
   - Ensures data is ingested in real-time.

5. **Data Transformation Layer**:
   - Flattens nested data structures into a tabular format.
   - Applies user-defined transformations (e.g., filtering, aggregation).

6. **Data Loading Layer**:
   - Writes the processed data into multiple tables in the target dataset.
   - Supports schema evolution and dynamic table creation.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Tracks pipeline performance, errors, and data quality.
   - Logs are stored in a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Cloud Logging).

8. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism**:
   - Handles failures during data ingestion, transformation, or loading.
   - Implements retry logic for transient errors.

9. **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**:
   - The framework is designed to scale horizontally to handle large volumes of data.
   - Apache Beam ensures fault tolerance through checkpointing and state management.

### **Detailed Workflow**
1. **Configuration Setup**:
   - The user configures the data sources, transformations, and destination tables in the MSSQL Server configuration tables.
   - Example configuration fields:
     - `SourceType`: Kafka, Pub/Sub, etc.
     - `SourceDetails`: Topic name, subscription ID, etc.
     - `TransformationLogic`: JSON path for flattening, filters, etc.
     - `DestinationTables`: Table names, column mappings, etc.

2. **Data Polling**:
   - The framework reads the configuration and starts polling data from the specified sources.
   - For Kafka, it subscribes to the configured topics.
   - For Pub/Sub, it pulls messages from the specified subscription.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - The ingested data is passed through the Apache Beam pipeline.
   - The pipeline applies the configured transformations, such as flattening nested JSON structures into rows and columns.

4. **Data Loading**:
   - The transformed data is written into the target dataset.
   - The framework dynamically maps the data to the appropriate tables based on the configuration.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - The framework continuously monitors the pipeline for errors and performance issues.
   - Logs are generated for each step (e.g., data ingestion, transformation, loading).

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If an error occurs, the framework retries the operation based on the configured retry policy.
   - Failed records are logged and can be reprocessed later.

### **Capabilities of the Framework**
1. **Multi-Source Support**:
   - Can ingest data from multiple streaming platforms (Kafka, Pub/Sub, etc.) simultaneously.

2. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Processes data in real-time, ensuring low latency.

3. **Configuration-Driven**:
   - All aspects of the pipeline are configurable, reducing the need for code changes.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Can handle large volumes of data by scaling horizontally.

5. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Ensures data integrity through checkpointing and retry mechanisms.

6. **Schema Evolution**:
   - Supports dynamic schema changes in the source data.

7. **Extensibility**:
   - New data sources and transformations can be added easily.

8. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Provides real-time monitoring and alerting for pipeline health.

9. **Portability**:
   - Apache Beam allows the pipeline to run on different execution engines (e.g., Google Dataflow, Apache Flink).

### **Example Configuration Tables**
1. **Source Configuration Table**:
   | SourceID | SourceType | SourceDetails          | PollingInterval |
   |----------|------------|------------------------|------------------|
   | 1        | Kafka      | Topic: orders          | 5000ms          |
   | 2        | Pub/Sub    | Subscription: logs     | 3000ms          |

2. **Transformation Configuration Table**:
   | TransformationID | SourceID | TransformationLogic                     |
   |------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
   | 1                | 1        | Flatten JSON: $.orders[*]               |
   | 2                | 2        | Filter: $.severity == "ERROR"           |

3. **Destination Configuration Table**:
   | DestinationID | SourceID | TableName  | ColumnMappings           |
   |---------------|----------|------------|--------------------------|
   | 1             | 1        | Orders     | {"order_id": "$.id"}     |
   | 2             | 2        | ErrorLogs  | {"log_id": "$.id"}       |

```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

class StreamDataPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config

    def run(self):
        options = PipelineOptions()
        with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
            (p
             | 'ReadFromSource' >> beam.io.ReadFromPubSub(subscription=self.config['pubsub_subscription'])
             | 'FlattenData' >> beam.Map(self.flatten_data)
             | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
                 table=self.config['destination_table'],
                 schema=self.config['schema'],
                 write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND)
             )

    def flatten_data(self, record):
        # Apply flattening logic based on configuration
        return {
            'order_id': record['id'],
            'customer_id': record['customer']['id'],
            'amount': record['amount']
        }

# Load configuration from MSSQL Server
config = load_config_from_mssql()
pipeline = StreamDataPipeline(config)
pipeline.run()
